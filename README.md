# ddev-gitpod-launcher
Launch and develop any web project in gitpod using ddev.

1. Get the https URL of the repository you want to work with.
2. (Optional) Provide database and user-generated files dumps in a (probably private) repository named `<repo>-artifacts`. For example. if you have a repository named `https://github.com/drud/d9simple` the private artifacts git repository will be at `https://github.com/drud/d9simple-artifacts`.
   * In that repository, check in `db.sql.gz` and `files.tgz` and push it. This only needs to be updated when you need to update it. 
   * For future use, you may want to implement a `ddev pull` integration, for example for Acquia or Pantheon or Platform.sh or any other of the example [providers](https://github.com/drud/ddev/tree/master/pkg/ddevapp/dotddev_assets/providers) (see [docs](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/providers/provider-introduction/)). The git technique is used here because you may not have any other initial way to get database and files into gitpod until you set something up.

Go to [DDEV gitpod launcher](https://drud.github.io/ddev-gitpod-launcher/) to launch any website project and edit and develop it in gitpod.

* If the project has a composer.json, the launcher will do a `ddev composer install`
* If the project has a .ddev/config.yaml, it will be respected, otherwise a default will be auto-generated.
